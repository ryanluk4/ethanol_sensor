# Ethanol Sensor

This is Arduino code for an Ethanol Sensor being designed by Peter Weiss and team.

As of (2/3/2020) the code displays a timestamp and relative humidity from a sensor (via analog input) on an LCD.

Team members include:
Sharukh "Sharky" Lal, Ryan Luk, James Zhou

# Objective

Design an ethanol sensor product that can be used in wineries to regulate ethanol concentrations.
